# Object-Distance-Measurement-using Ultra-sonic-Distance-Sensor
To begin, place an object of your choosing roughly 0.5 meters away from the Raspberry Pi. Write a
Python script to perform the following tasks:
1. Record a still image of the scene using either raspistill or picamera
2. Using the ultrasonic distance sensor, record 10 successive distance measurements between the
Pi and the object
3. Calculate and print the average of the 10 distance measurements onto the image using OpenCV
